# Risc0 Merkle Tree Root Hash Verifier

This demo project is intended to show how the computations performed on Cartesi Machine could be verified using Risc0 technology.

## Quickstart

Use `make run-local` to run the prover.

## Options

To generate test data that simulates memory pages, use `make data`. Adjust `config.yaml` to change the parameters of the generated data.
